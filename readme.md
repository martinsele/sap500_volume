# S\&P500 Volume prediction
This repository contains analysis of a timeseries for traded volume of a S\&P500 index together with an implementation of various methods for prediction of traded volume on S\&P500.

- Autoregressive SARIMAX model
- Random Forest regressor
- LSTM neural network model

Implemented features:
- grid search with time-series CV splits
- optional periodic retraining during evaluation

The results are summarized in the report PDF file.
